## _Marrow SDK Enhanced_ ##

A project with everything set up for BONELAB mod development.

Many people find it hard to set up a Unity project for BONELAB mod development.
 This template aims to simplify the process, by pre-installing all required packages,
 and some extra useful ones too. This should minimize the confusion when setting up
 projects, and allow new (and old) modders to focus more on their idea, and less
 on the daunting task of project setup. This template is still in early access, so
 please report any issues [Here](https://github.com/techsideofficial/MarrowSDKEnhanced/issues). Have fun!
